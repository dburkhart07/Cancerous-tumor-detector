# Cancerous-tumor-detector
Trains a model that, based on the dataset given, tells you the likelihood that a new tumor is cancerous.
Using the starter csv file provided, treats every column in the dataset aside from the first as the independent variables. Based on those columns, runs 1000 tests on that help it determine whether a tumor is either 'm' (cancerous) or 'b' (noncancerous). This trained model, when evaluated at the end, has consistently 95% accuracy at using the data in a given row to decipher whether the tumor is cancerous or not.
